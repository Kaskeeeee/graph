/// graph. Then it uses the Bellman Ford algorithm from the new vertex q, to
/// find for each vertex v the minimum weight h(v) of a path from q to v. After
/// reweighting the the edges of the original graph using the values computed by
/// the Bellman Ford algorithm, q is removed and Dijkstra algorithm is used
/// to find the shortest paths from each node s to every other vertex in the
