/// @brief Implementation of Ford Fulkerson algorithm. Ford Fulkerson performs a
/// BFS or DFS in order to find a path from the source (starting vertex) to the
/// sink (goal vertex), with available capacity on all edges in the path. If
/// there is a path, the algorithm sends flow along it, taking some of the
/// capacity of the edges. Then it finds another path, and so on. The algorithms
/// terminates when there isn't a path with enough capacity on its edges,
/// returning the maximum flow from the source to the sink.
/// @tparam G type of input graph
/// @tparam Flow type of flow and capacity of the edges
/// @param graph graph on which the algorithm will run
/// @param source starting vertex
/// @param sink goal vertex
/// @param capacity edges capacity
/// @return a number, which is the maximum flow from source to sink in the given
/// graph
