/// (a set of trees), where each vertex in the graph is a separate tree, Kruskal
/// iters on each edge, in increasing weight order. If the edge connects two
/// different trees then the algorithms adds it to the forest , combining two
/// trees into a single tree. At the termination of the algorithm, the forest
/// forms a minimum spanning forest or tree.
